  <h2>Learning Tool For Practicing Swedish Words and Sayings</h2>
</div>

## Features
- **Become Proficient In Swedish:** You don't just wake up being able to talk and think in another language. It takes effort and a lot of practice and that is exactly why this exists.
- **Includes Settings:** Choosing what or when to show undefined articles like a/an or translation makes it even a better tool.
- **Session History:** Easily keep track of practiced words or time spent learning by looking at the history session situated at the bottom of the screen so it does not distract you in any way.
